        <h1>Some basic knowledge of DOM, JS Events and Callback Function</h1>

            <li>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</li>
            <li>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</li>
            <li>What is event bubble?</li>

            <h3 class="mb-3">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
            <p>In Javascript Language, DOM stands for Document Object Model. An API integrated into Browsers creates a model of an HTML document called the Document Object Model. Using JS DOM, we can do CRUD operation into the HTML document. CRUD means Create, Read, Update & Delete.  We can manipulate everything in HTML documents by JS DOM.</p>
            <h3 class="mb-3">2.How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.?</h3>
            <p>There are several ways of selecting HTML Elements. It's a part of traversing the DOM. If we want to manipulate any HTML elements in DOM, first we need to select the elements. In order to select the elements some particular methods are used mentioned below- </p>
            <ol>
                <li>getELementById(),</li>
                <li>getElementsByClassName(),</li>
                <li>getElementsByTagName(),</li>
                <li>getElementsName(),</li>
                <li>querySelector(),</li>
                <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
            </ol> 
            <h3 class="mb-3">3.What is event bubble?</h3>
            <p>It's a phase of event propagation. When an event is triggered in the web site, browser first find the event from the parent element to the event target element. If it find similar event than it executes the event, by this way the similar events are executed and finally executes the target event. It means events propagating from the parent to the target element. It's called Event Capturing. It's not the default event propagation in DOM. On the otherhand, by default event propagates from target elements to the parent of the target element where the event is first occured. It's called Event Bubble which is reverse of Event Capture </p>
            <h3 class="mb-3">3.What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
            <p>Callback Function is a code block, used as an argument to another function. If the function is not called anywhere, it will not execute. It actually a form of Data that is reusable. We can store some repeative reuseable data, instructions etc. through callback function. When we would call the function to another function or pass as an argument to another code block then it will add an impact to the programm but not before. That is why it's called Callback Function.
            It reduces the code iteration as well as the execution time. which is very important in any programming language. And users feel the best user experience.</p>
